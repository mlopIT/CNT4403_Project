Typically, when users create passwords for logging into an online service, the following special characters are commonly allowed:

1. Exclamation mark (!) <--- One of the most universally allowed special characters.
2. At sign (@) <--- Another one of the most universally allowed special characters.
3. Dollar sign ($)
4. Percent sign (%)
5. Hash (#)
6. Ampersand (&)
7. Asterisk (*)

However, it's worth noting that some services may not allow all of these characters or may have specific restrictions on password length and complexity.

In general, most online services follow the guidelines set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for strong passwords:

* Minimum 8-12 characters in length
* Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters
* At least one number
* At least one special character (such as those listed above)

It's also common for services to have specific requirements, such as:

* No spaces or special characters at the beginning or end of the password
* No consecutive repeating characters (e.g., "aaa" or "111")
* No easily guessable information (e.g., name, birthdate, common words)

Keep in mind that different services may have varying password policies, so it's always a good idea to check with the specific service you're using for their exact requirements.
